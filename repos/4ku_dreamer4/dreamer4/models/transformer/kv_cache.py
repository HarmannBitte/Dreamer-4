"""
KV cache for incremental decoding of the block-causal transformer.

When the dynamics model rolls out autoregressively (paper Section 3.2), each new frame costs
K denoising steps that all condition on the same fixed past; without a cache every one of
those steps re-runs the whole transformer over the whole past.

Time attention is the *only* operation in this architecture that mixes across timesteps
(space attention stays inside one frame, the MLP is per token), so the past reaches a new
token only through time attention's K and V. The cache holds exactly those tensors — stored
post-QKNorm and post-RoPE — for each time-attention layer, and nothing else. Layers without
time attention have no cross-time state and never touch the cache.

class KVCache:
    """
    K/V cache indexed by time-attention layer.

    For each time-attention layer ``L`` the cache stores two tensors of shape
    ``(N, n_kv_heads, T_cached, head_dim)`` (with ``N = B * S`` — the
    flattened (batch, spatial) axis that time attention operates over).
    Tensors are stored **post-QKNorm and post-RoPE** so that the incremental
    forward only needs to project K, V for the new tokens and concatenate.

    Layer indices without time attention are simply absent from the cache — they have no
    cross-time state to remember.

    Args:
        time_layer_indices: Layer indices (into the transformer's ``layers``
            list) that perform time attention and therefore need a slot.
        max_T: Maximum number of past frames the cache is allowed to hold.
            The transformer is responsible for enforcing this bound — when a
            commit would exceed ``max_T``, it evicts the oldest cached frames
            (re-rotating the remaining K via :func:`dreamer4.models.transformer.rope.shift_rope`)
            so that ``t_cached <= max_T`` always holds post-commit.
