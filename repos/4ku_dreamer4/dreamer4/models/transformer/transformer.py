"""
Block-causal transformer: the backbone shared by the tokenizer and the dynamics model.

Stacks ``depth`` BlockCausalLayers and applies a final RMSNorm; input and output are both
``(B, T, S, D)``. Every layer runs space attention (within a timestep, under the layout's
modality mask) and a SwiGLU MLP; every ``time_every``-th layer also runs causal time
attention, so a token sees its own timestep in full and past timesteps at its own spatial
position. RoPE supplies positions (independently along the space and time axes), GQA keeps
the KV cache small, and QKNorm plus attention-logit capping keep the deep stack stable.

    Input (B, T, S, D)
      -> [layer 0]  space + mlp
      -> [layer 1]  space + mlp
      -> [layer 2]  space + mlp
      -> [layer 3]  space + TIME + mlp        (time_every=4)
      -> ...
      -> RMSNorm
      -> Output (B, T, S, D)

The caller supplies the TokenLayout that defines S and the mask mode:

    tokenizer encoder:  TokenLayout(n_latents=16, segments=((Modality.IMAGE, 196),))
                        with space_mode="encoder"
    dynamics model:     TokenLayout(n_latents=0, segments=((Modality.ACTION, 1),
                        (Modality.SHORTCUT_SIGNAL, 1), (Modality.SPATIAL, 128),
                        (Modality.REGISTER, 4), (Modality.AGENT, 1)))
                        with space_mode="wm_agent"

``forward`` doubles as the rollout path: hand it a ``KVCache`` (from ``make_kv_cache``) and it
attends against cached past K/V instead of recomputing the past. ``patchify`` / ``unpatchify``
live here too — the pixel-space helpers that turn frames into patch tokens and back.
